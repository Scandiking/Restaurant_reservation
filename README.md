> For this exercise, we will create a small program that will make table reservations for a restaurant. Each table is 
> characterized by its capacity. For simplicity, we will divide the reservation time into one-hour intervals; a reservation can cover multiple consecutive intervals.  
>
> For the customer, we need to know the name, phone number, and possibly other details.  
>
> For the table, we need to include the capacity (the number of people the table can accommodate) and the table ID/number.  
>
> For the reservation, we need to include references to the customer and table. We also need to include how long the reservation will last.  
>
> A Restaurant.java class should implement the functionality for creating reservations.  
>
> The following files must be created: 
> - Kunde.java, 
> - Bord.java, 
> - Reservasjon.java, 
> - Restaurant.java.  
>
> We need to create a method that adds a reference to a table in a list of tables.  
>
> We need a method that checks if a table is available or not within a time period.  
>
> We need a method that can search through all tables that are available within a time period.  
>
> We need a method to create a new reservation, and we need a method to print all available reservations to the console.  
>
> Finally, we need a main() method to test what we have created. In Restaurant.java, we can add some tables and then try to find available tables for new reservations. Finally, print out all available reservations.
